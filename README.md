WoW-Addon: Miscellaneous tweaks and improvements

This addon contains several customizations that I felt were missing, among them ...

* searchable spell book
* tradeskill tooltips when hovering lines in the profession book
* on respec, combine unlearned and learned messages (and filter duplicates)
* search your spellbook for unused/unbound spells (supports action bars, shapeshift bars, Clique config)
* add train all button to trainer dialogs
